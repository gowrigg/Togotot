** Overview of the project

*** Project: Explorator Data Analysis (EDA) on Apple stock price dataset

*** Objective
The objective of this project is to perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to
gain insights into the data.

*** Key Activities
**Data cleaning** : Ensuring the data is free from missing values and data irregularities
**Data Visualization**: Show the characteristics of the taken data and distribution we use visualisation libraries.
**Analysis**: To analyse them with the visual graphs and chart type models 

*** Technologies Used
**python**: For data analysis due to its simplicity, readability, and the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
**Pandas**: Functions for reading/writing data from various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL databases). And Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
**Numpy**: Provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large collection of mathematical functions.
**Matplotlib**: Helps create static, interactive, and animated plots.
**Seaborn**:  higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
